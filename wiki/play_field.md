# PlayField

The playfield is the grid into which tetrominoes fall,
also called the "well" (common in older games)
or the "matrix" (especially in more recent Tetris brand games).
The playfield is surrounded by a frame called the tetrion,
which controls the overall behavior of tetrominoes.

The vast majority of tetromino based game 
use a playfield 10 cells wide and between 16 and 24 cells tall.
